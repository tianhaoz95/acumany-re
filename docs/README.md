#### Overview

For simplicity, we use [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) as the documentation tool for public information.

#### View docs

To view the docs in local repository, follow the [instructions](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart?id=quick-start) to install Docsify, and then run the command `docsify serve docs` in the repository root directory.

#### Modify docs

To modify the docs, simply create/remove/modify the `README` files in the `docs` directory and open a pull request to check in the code (no further actions are needed).
